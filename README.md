## What's New

### v1.4.1 — Bug Fix (Feb 2026)

- **Fixed instinct import content loss** — `parse_instinct_file()` was silently dropping all content after frontmatter (Action, Evidence, Examples sections) during `/instinct-import`. Fixed by community contributor @ericcai0814 ([#148](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/issues/148), [#161](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/pull/161))

### v1.4.0 — Multi-Language Rules, Installation Wizard & PM2 (Feb 2026)

- **Interactive installation wizard** — New `configure-ecc` skill provides guided setup with merge/overwrite detection
- **PM2 & multi-agent orchestration** — 6 new commands (`/pm2`, `/multi-plan`, `/multi-execute`, `/multi-backend`, `/multi-frontend`, `/multi-workflow`) for managing complex multi-service workflows
- **Multi-language rules architecture** — Rules restructured from flat files into `common/` + `typescript/` + `python/` + `golang/` directories. Install only the languages you need
- **Chinese (zh-CN) translations** — Complete translation of all agents, commands, skills, and rules (80+ files)
- **GitHub Sponsors support** — Sponsor the project via GitHub Sponsors
- **Enhanced CONTRIBUTING.md** — Detailed PR templates for each contribution type

### v1.3.0 — OpenCode Plugin Support (Feb 2026)

- **Full OpenCode integration** — 12 agents, 24 commands, 16 skills with hook support via OpenCode's plugin system (20+ event types)
- **3 native custom tools** — run-tests, check-coverage, security-audit
- **LLM documentation** — `llms.txt` for comprehensive OpenCode docs

### v1.2.0 — Unified Commands & Skills (Feb 2026)

- **Python/Django support** — Django patterns, security, TDD, and verification skills
- **Java Spring Boot skills** — Patterns, security, TDD, and verification for Spring Boot
- **Session management** — `/sessions` command for session history
- **Continuous learning v2** — Instinct-based learning with confidence scoring, import/export, evolution

See the full changelog in [Releases](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/releases).

## 🚀 Quick Start

Get up and running in under 2 minutes:

### Step 1: Install the Plugin

```bash
# Add marketplace
/plugin marketplace add affaan-m/everything-claude-code

# Install plugin
/plugin install everything-claude-code@everything-claude-code
```

### Step 2: Install Rules (Required)

> ⚠️ **Important:** Claude Code plugins cannot distribute `rules` automatically. Install them manually:


```bash
# Clone the repo first
git clone https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code.git
cd everything-claude-code

# Recommended: use the installer (handles common + language rules safely)
./install.sh typescript    # or python or golang
# You can pass multiple languages:
# ./install.sh typescript python golang
# or target cursor:
# ./install.sh --target cursor typescript
```

For manual install instructions see the README in the `rules/` folder.

### Step 3: Start Using

```bash
# Try a command
/plan "Add user authentication"

# Check available commands
/plugin list everything-claude-code@everything-claude-code
```

✨ **That's it!** You now have access to 13 agents, 37 skills, and 31 commands.

---

## 🌐 Cross-Platform Support

This plugin now fully supports **Windows, macOS, and Linux**. All hooks and scripts have been rewritten in Node.js for maximum compatibility.

### Package Manager Detection

The plugin automatically detects your preferred package manager (npm, pnpm, yarn, or bun) with the following priority:

1. **Environment variable**: `CLAUDE_PACKAGE_MANAGER`
2. **Project config**: `.claude/package-manager.json`
3. **package.json**: `packageManager` field
4. **Lock file**: Detection from package-lock.json, yarn.lock, pnpm-lock.yaml, or bun.lockb
5. **Global config**: `~/.claude/package-manager.json`
6. **Fallback**: First available package manager

To set your preferred package manager:

```bash
# Via environment variable
export CLAUDE_PACKAGE_MANAGER=pnpm

# Via global config
node scripts/setup-package-manager.js --global pnpm

# Via project config
node scripts/setup-package-manager.js --project bun

# Detect current setting
node scripts/setup-package-manager.js --detect
```

Or use the `/setup-pm` command in Claude Code.

## 🛠️ Ecosystem Tools

### Skill Creator

Two ways to generate Claude Code skills from your repository:

#### Option A: Local Analysis (Built-in)

Use the `/skill-create` command for local analysis without external services:

```bash
/skill-create                    # Analyze current repo
/skill-create --instincts        # Also generate instincts for continuous-learning
```

This analyzes your git history locally and generates SKILL.md files.

#### Option B: GitHub App (Advanced)

For advanced features (10k+ commits, auto-PRs, team sharing):

[Install GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/skill-creator) | [ecc.tools](https://ecc.tools)

```bash
# Comment on any issue:
/skill-creator analyze

# Or auto-triggers on push to default branch
```

Both options create:
- **SKILL.md files** - Ready-to-use skills for Claude Code
- **Instinct collections** - For continuous-learning-v2
- **Pattern extraction** - Learns from your commit history

### AgentShield — Security Auditor

> Built at the Claude Code Hackathon (Cerebral Valley x Anthropic, Feb 2026). 751 tests, 98% coverage, 73 static analysis rules.

Scan your Claude Code configuration for vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and injection risks.

```bash
# Quick scan (no install needed)
npx ecc-agentshield scan

# Auto-fix safe issues
npx ecc-agentshield scan --fix

# Deep analysis with three Opus 4.6 agents
npx ecc-agentshield scan --opus --stream

# Generate secure config from scratch
npx ecc-agentshield init
```

**What it scans:** CLAUDE.md, settings.json, MCP configs, hooks, agent definitions, and skills across 5 categories — secrets detection (14 patterns), permission auditing, hook injection analysis, MCP server risk profiling, and agent config review.

**The `--opus` flag** runs three Claude Opus 4.6 agents in a red-team/blue-team/auditor pipeline. The attacker finds exploit chains, the defender evaluates protections, and the auditor synthesizes both into a prioritized risk assessment. Adversarial reasoning, not just pattern matching.

**Output formats:** Terminal (color-graded A-F), JSON (CI pipelines), Markdown, HTML. Exit code 2 on critical findings for build gates.

Use `/security-scan` in Claude Code to run it, or add to CI with the [GitHub Action](https://github.com/affaan-m/agentshield).

[GitHub](https://github.com/affaan-m/agentshield) | [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ecc-agentshield)

### 🧠 Continuous Learning v2

The instinct-based learning system automatically learns your patterns:

```bash
/instinct-status        # Show learned instincts with confidence
/instinct-import <file> # Import instincts from others
/instinct-export        # Export your instincts for sharing
/evolve                 # Cluster related instincts into skills
```

See `skills/continuous-learning-v2/` for full documentation.

---

## 📋 Requirements

### Claude Code CLI Version

**Minimum version: v2.1.0 or later**

This plugin requires Claude Code CLI v2.1.0+ due to changes in how the plugin system handles hooks.

Check your version:
```bash
claude --version
```

### Important: Hooks Auto-Loading Behavior

> ⚠️ **For Contributors:** Do NOT add a `"hooks"` field to `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. This is enforced by a regression test.

Claude Code v2.1+ **automatically loads** `hooks/hooks.json` from any installed plugin by convention. Explicitly declaring it in `plugin.json` causes a duplicate detection error:

```
Duplicate hooks file detected: ./hooks/hooks.json resolves to already-loaded file
```

**History:** This has caused repeated fix/revert cycles in this repo ([#29](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/issues/29), [#52](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/issues/52), [#103](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/issues/103)). The behavior changed between Claude Code versions, leading to confusion. We now have a regression test to prevent this from being reintroduced.

---

## 📥 Installation

### Option 1: Install as Plugin (Recommended)

The easiest way to use this repo - install as a Claude Code plugin:

```bash
# Add this repo as a marketplace
/plugin marketplace add affaan-m/everything-claude-code

# Install the plugin
/plugin install everything-claude-code@everything-claude-code
```

Or add directly to your `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "everything-claude-code": {
      "source": {
        "source": "github",
        "repo": "affaan-m/everything-claude-code"
      }
    }
  },
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "everything-claude-code@everything-claude-code": true
  }
}
```

This gives you instant access to all commands, agents, skills, and hooks.

> **Note:** The Claude Code plugin system does not support distributing `rules` via plugins ([upstream limitation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins-reference)). You need to install rules manually:
>
> ```bash
> # Clone the repo first
> git clone https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code.git
>
> # Option A: User-level rules (applies to all projects)
> cp -r everything-claude-code/rules/common/* ~/.claude/rules/
> cp -r everything-claude-code/rules/typescript/* ~/.claude/rules/   # pick your stack
> cp -r everything-claude-code/rules/python/* ~/.claude/rules/
> cp -r everything-claude-code/rules/golang/* ~/.claude/rules/
>
> # Option B: Project-level rules (applies to current project only)
> mkdir -p .claude/rules
> cp -r everything-claude-code/rules/common/* .claude/rules/
> cp -r everything-claude-code/rules/typescript/* .claude/rules/     # pick your stack
> ```

---

### 🔧 Option 2: Manual Installation

If you prefer manual control over what's installed:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code.git

# Copy agents to your Claude config
cp everything-claude-code/agents/*.md ~/.claude/agents/

# Copy rules (common + language-specific)
cp -r everything-claude-code/rules/common/* ~/.claude/rules/
cp -r everything-claude-code/rules/typescript/* ~/.claude/rules/   # pick your stack
cp -r everything-claude-code/rules/python/* ~/.claude/rules/
cp -r everything-claude-code/rules/golang/* ~/.claude/rules/

# Copy commands
cp everything-claude-code/commands/*.md ~/.claude/commands/

# Copy skills
cp -r everything-claude-code/skills/* ~/.claude/skills/
```

#### Add hooks to settings.json

Copy the hooks from `hooks/hooks.json` to your `~/.claude/settings.json`.

#### Configure MCPs

Copy desired MCP servers from `mcp-configs/mcp-servers.json` to your `~/.claude.json`.

**Important:** Replace `YOUR_*_HERE` placeholders with your actual API keys.

## 🎯 Key Concepts

### Agents

Subagents handle delegated tasks with limited scope. Example:

```markdown
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Reviews code for quality, security, and maintainability
tools: ["Read", "Grep", "Glob", "Bash"]
model: opus
---

You are a senior code reviewer...
```

### Skills

Skills are workflow definitions invoked by commands or agents:

```markdown
# TDD Workflow

1. Define interfaces first
2. Write failing tests (RED)
3. Implement minimal code (GREEN)
4. Refactor (IMPROVE)
5. Verify 80%+ coverage
```

### Hooks

Hooks fire on tool events. Example - warn about console.log:

```json
{
  "matcher": "tool == \"Edit\" && tool_input.file_path matches \"\\\\.(ts|tsx|js|jsx)$\"",
  "hooks": [{
    "type": "command",
    "command": "#!/bin/bash\ngrep -n 'console\\.log' \"$file_path\" && echo '[Hook] Remove console.log' >&2"
  }]
}
```

### Rules

Rules are always-follow guidelines, organized into `common/` (language-agnostic) + language-specific directories:

```
rules/
  common/          # Universal principles (always install)
  typescript/      # TS/JS specific patterns and tools
  python/          # Python specific patterns and tools
  golang/          # Go specific patterns and tools
```

See [`rules/README.md`](rules/README.md) for installation and structure details.

## 🗺️ Which Agent Should I Use?

Not sure where to start? Use this quick reference:

| I want to... | Use this command | Agent used |
|--------------|-----------------|------------|
| Plan a new feature | `/plan "Add auth"` | planner |
| Design system architecture | `/plan` + architect agent | architect |
| Write code with tests first | `/tdd` | tdd-guide |
| Review code I just wrote | `/code-review` | code-reviewer |
| Fix a failing build | `/build-fix` | build-error-resolver |
| Run end-to-end tests | `/e2e` | e2e-runner |
| Find security vulnerabilities | `/security-scan` | security-reviewer |
| Remove dead code | `/refactor-clean` | refactor-cleaner |
| Update documentation | `/update-docs` | doc-updater |
| Review Go code | `/go-review` | go-reviewer |
| Review Python code | `/python-review` | python-reviewer |
| Audit database queries | *(auto-delegated)* | database-reviewer |

### Common Workflows

**Starting a new feature:**
```
/plan "Add user authentication with OAuth"   → planner creates implementation blueprint
/tdd                                          → tdd-guide enforces write-tests-first
/code-review                                  → code-reviewer checks your work
```

**Fixing a bug:**
```
/tdd                                          → tdd-guide: write a failing test that reproduces it
                                              → implement the fix, verify test passes
/code-review                                  → code-reviewer: catch regressions
```

**Preparing for production:**
```
/security-scan                                → security-reviewer: OWASP Top 10 audit
/e2e                                          → e2e-runner: critical user flow tests
/test-coverage                                → verify 80%+ coverage
```

## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>How do I check which agents/commands are installed?</b></summary>

```bash
/plugin list everything-claude-code@everything-claude-code
```

This shows all available agents, commands, and skills from the plugin.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>My hooks aren't working / I see "Duplicate hooks file" errors</b></summary>

This is the most common issue. **Do NOT add a `"hooks"` field to `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.** Claude Code v2.1+ automatically loads `hooks/hooks.json` from installed plugins. Explicitly declaring it causes duplicate detection errors. See [#29](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/issues/29), [#52](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/issues/52), [#103](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/issues/103).
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>My context window is shrinking / Claude is running out of context</b></summary>

Too many MCP servers eat your context. Each MCP tool description consumes tokens from your 200k window, potentially reducing it to ~70k.

**Fix:** Disable unused MCPs per project:
```json
// In your project's .claude/settings.json
{
  "disabledMcpServers": ["supabase", "railway", "vercel"]
}
```

Keep under 10 MCPs enabled and under 80 tools active.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I use only some components (e.g., just agents)?</b></summary>

Yes. Use Option 2 (manual installation) and copy only what you need:

```bash
# Just agents
cp everything-claude-code/agents/*.md ~/.claude/agents/

# Just rules
cp -r everything-claude-code/rules/common/* ~/.claude/rules/
```

Each component is fully independent.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Does this work with Cursor / OpenCode?</b></summary>

Yes. ECC is cross-platform:
- **Cursor**: Pre-translated configs in `.cursor/`. See [Cursor IDE Support](#cursor-ide-support).
- **OpenCode**: Full plugin support in `.opencode/`. See [OpenCode Support](#-opencode-support).
- **Claude Code**: Native — this is the primary target.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How do I contribute a new skill or agent?</b></summary>

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). The short version:
1. Fork the repo
2. Create your skill in `skills/your-skill-name/SKILL.md` (with YAML frontmatter)
3. Or create an agent in `agents/your-agent.md`
4. Submit a PR with a clear description of what it does and when to use it

## 📖 Background

I've been using Claude Code since the experimental rollout. Won the Anthropic x Forum Ventures hackathon in Sep 2025 building [zenith.chat](https://zenith.chat) with [@DRodriguezFX](https://x.com/DRodriguezFX) - entirely using Claude Code.

These configs are battle-tested across multiple production applications.

## Token Optimization

Claude Code usage can be expensive if you don't manage token consumption. These settings significantly reduce costs without sacrificing quality.

### Recommended Settings

Add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "model": "sonnet",
  "env": {
    "MAX_THINKING_TOKENS": "10000",
    "CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE": "50"
  }
}
```

| Setting | Default | Recommended | Impact |
|---------|---------|-------------|--------|
| `model` | opus | **sonnet** | ~60% cost reduction; handles 80%+ of coding tasks |
| `MAX_THINKING_TOKENS` | 31,999 | **10,000** | ~70% reduction in hidden thinking cost per request |
| `CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE` | 95 | **50** | Compacts earlier — better quality in long sessions |

Switch to Opus only when you need deep architectural reasoning:
```
/model opus
```

### Daily Workflow Commands

| Command | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|
| `/model sonnet` | Default for most tasks |
| `/model opus` | Complex architecture, debugging, deep reasoning |
| `/clear` | Between unrelated tasks (free, instant reset) |
| `/compact` | At logical task breakpoints (research done, milestone complete) |
| `/cost` | Monitor token spending during session |

### Strategic Compaction

The `strategic-compact` skill (included in this plugin) suggests `/compact` at logical breakpoints instead of relying on auto-compaction at 95% context. See `skills/strategic-compact/SKILL.md` for the full decision guide.

**When to compact:**
- After research/exploration, before implementation
- After completing a milestone, before starting the next
- After debugging, before continuing feature work
- After a failed approach, before trying a new one

**When NOT to compact:**
- Mid-implementation (you'll lose variable names, file paths, partial state)

### Context Window Management

**Critical:** Don't enable all MCPs at once. Each MCP tool description consumes tokens from your 200k window, potentially reducing it to ~70k.

- Keep under 10 MCPs enabled per project
- Keep under 80 tools active
- Use `disabledMcpServers` in project config to disable unused ones

### Agent Teams Cost Warning

Agent Teams spawns multiple context windows. Each teammate consumes tokens independently. Only use for tasks where parallelism provides clear value (multi-module work, parallel reviews). For simple sequential tasks, subagents are more token-efficient.

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Customization

These configs work for my workflow. You should:
1. Start with what resonates
2. Modify for your stack
3. Remove what you don't use
4. Add your own patterns
